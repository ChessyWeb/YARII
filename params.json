Some parts of code are forked from these great projects :*\r\n\r\n- [MattWilcox/Adaptative-Images](https://github.com/MattWilcox/Adaptive-Images \"MattWilcox/Adaptative-Images\")\r\n- [adamdbradley/foresight.js](https://github.com/adamdbradley/foresight.js/ \"adamdbradley/foresight.js\")\r\n- [drewbrolik/Responsive-Img](https://github.com/drewbrolik/Responsive-Img \"drewbrolik/Responsive-Img\")\r\n\r\n*Go check them, they really are inspiring projects.*\r\n\r\n## How does it work ? ##\r\nYARII's action is divided in 2 steps: \r\n\r\n1. YARII intercepts images requests on server side and send an appropriate image to the client depending on  its **resolution** (also detecting **HD screens)** and its **bandwidth**.\r\n\r\n2. YARII starts reloading full quality image as **background task**, **if necessary** (i.e. image quality too low for the client). When load is complete, the low quality image get replaced, optionally with animation.\r\n\r\n\r\n## So what about browsers without Javascript enabled ? ##\r\nYARII is based on a **Progressive Enhancement** philosophy. Recent publications stated that images should be sent to non-js browser in low quality by default (mobile first behavior).\r\n\r\nYARII let you choose wether you want to sent low quality images or original images to non-js browsers.\r\n\r\nBut just remember that **YARII is able to detect searchbots like Google's**, so that the images sent to them are always in full quality, even if you choose mobile first approach. Your SEO is safe !\r\n\r\n## Installation ##\r\n\r\nComing very soon... :)\r\n","google":"UA-44339411-1","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
